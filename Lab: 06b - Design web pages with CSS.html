            In Time is a 2011 American science fiction action film written, directed and produced by Andrew Niccol.
            Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake star as inhabitants in a society where people stop aging at 25.
            Instead of using banknotes, a new economic system uses time as currency, and each person has a clock on
            their arm that counts down how long they have to live. Cillian Murphy, Vincent Kartheiser, Olivia Wilde,
            Matt Bomer, Johnny Galecki, Collins Pennie and Alex Pettyfer also star. The film was released on October 28,
            2011.

        <p id="c">
            In 2169, people are genetically engineered to stop aging on their 25th birthday, when a one-year countdown
            on their forearm begins. When it reaches zero, the person "times out" and dies instantly. Time has thus
            become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in "time capsules". Several
            major areas called Time Zones exist; Dayton is the poorest, a manufacturing "ghetto" where people rarely
            have over 24 hours on their clocks, whereas in New Greenwich, people have enough time to be essentially
            immortal.

            Will Salas, a 28-year-old Dayton factory worker, lives with his 50-year-old mother Rachel. One night, he
            rescues a drunken 105-year-old man named Henry Hamilton from 75-year-old Fortis and his Minutemen, a group
            of time-robbing thugs. In a secret location, Hamilton, who has 116 years on his clock but is tired of
            living, reveals to Will that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time, while constantly increasing
            prices to keep poorer people dying. The next morning, he transfers all but 5 minutes of his time to a
            sleeping Will, then times out by falling off a bridge before Will can stop him. Raymond Leon, the
            75-year-old leader of a unit of police-like Timekeepers, erroneously assumes Will robbed and killed
            Hamilton.
